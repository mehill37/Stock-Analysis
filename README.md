# VBA Challenge Stock Analysis
Using Visual Basic and Macros in Excel

## Overview of Project
Breakdown of high yield stocks and the yearly return on them

### Purpose
To project which ticker's had a positive return at the end of 2018 so we can either invest or sell based on the outcomes.

## Analysis of Stock data from 2018
Most ticker's with a high daily volume had large losses at the end of 2018. Only two ticker's, ENPH and RUN, had a positive return. 

## Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
According to the data the market was suffering and many stock holders lost their investments at the end of 2018. 

Using Macros in Excel is very complicated. I could understand the thought process behind how it was written from what was shown to me, but it was very hard to understand how to write it out myself. It still feels like learning another language.

## Results and Conclusion
Buying stock in ENPH and RUN following the 2018 results would likely have the best chance at a positive return at the end of the next year.

This macro coded excel file can be applied to the coming years to yield more results so we have projections of the best ticker investments.

### Limitations found
When completing the module the last portion was intended to make the coded produce results for either the year 2017 or 2018. It was not explained properly and what I tried did not work. Then when going into the Chanllenge info it looks like it originally wanted results for both years sent in but only shows to submit 2018, but twice. A bit confusing, but I understand it as you should only need results from the year 2018.

### Other possible ways to convey the data

This could have been completed without using Macros. The excel functions (learned in Module 1 of Data Vis BootCamp) could have easily been applied to create the same table. The button function is a great tool though and I will likely use that again.
